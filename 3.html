        <h1>⚡ Understanding <span>Electric Charge</span></h1>

        <p><strong>Electric charge</strong> is a fundamental property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electric field.</p>

        <p>There are two types of electric charge:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Positive charge (+)</strong>: Carried by protons, found in the nucleus of an atom.</li>
            <li><strong>Negative charge (-)</strong>: Carried by electrons, which orbit the nucleus.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Important Rule</strong>: Like charges repel, while opposite charges attract. (Based on <strong>Coulomb’s Law</strong>)</p>
